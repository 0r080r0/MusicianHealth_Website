# Website for PhD Portfolio

This website showcases my journey and skills for a PhD in Musician's Mental and Physical Health.

It is a mix of my research and music industry expertise as well as experience as an active musician.

I am a self-taught musician, who started singing (and playing the guitar) at age 16, and playing the drums at age 17. 

Ever since, I have been very passionate about music - whether it is working behind the scenes in the music industry, making music, analysing inspiring artists or thinking of ways to improve musician's health!

Thus, I want to share my passion and knowledge to contribute to sustainable, healthy careers for musicians.
