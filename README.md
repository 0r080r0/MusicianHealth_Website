https://0r080r0-musicians-health.netlify.app/

This website showcases my journey and skills for a PhD in Musician's Mental and Physical Health, sharing my journey as a musician, my behind-the-scenes work in the music industry, and my ongoing commitment to advancing the well-being of musicians.

I am a self-taught musician, having started singing and playing guitar at 16 and drums at 17. My passion for music has driven me to explore both performance and industry roles, from creating music and engaging with audiences to working behind the scenes on various projects. This diverse experience has given me a deep understanding of the challenges musicians face in both their craft and their careers.

Through this website, I share my music, projects, and collaborations, alongside my publications and insights into the importance of mental and physical health in the music profession. 

Thus, I want to share my passion and knowledge to contribute to sustainable, healthy careers for musicians.
